_This security system is a work-in-progress._ 

## BACKGROUND

I find myself needing a comprehensive security system that notifies me of incursions (or excursions) especially at night without first resorting to sirens. This notification should take multiple forms including the traditional sirens as well as Twitter or SMS. I want full control over the system and do not want to pay someone a monthly monitoring fee. I want to be able to monitor key characteristics such as temperature, humidity, water on the basement floor, etc.

## OVERVIEW
This system will be built upon the Arduino open source hardware platform. It will use one Arduino (probably an [RBBB](http://shop.moderndevice.com/products/rbbb-kit) from Modern Device)
