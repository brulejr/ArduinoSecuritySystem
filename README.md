## BACKGROUND

I find myself needing a comprehensive security system that notifies me of 
incursions (or excursions) especially at night without first resorting to 
sirens. This notification should take multiple forms including the traditional
sirens as well as Twitter or SMS. I want full control over the system and do not
want to pay someone a monthly monitoring fee. I want to be able to monitor key 
characteristics such as temperature, humidity, water on the basement floor, etc.

## OVERVIEW
This is a security system built upon the Arduino open source hardware platform.
